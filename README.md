JavaSimulationFramework
=======================

This is a simulation framework in Java using Swing.  The purpose of this simple framework is to run code examples from the book, The Nature of Code, by Daniel Shiffman.  The book's example code was intended to be run in a Java-like programming framework, Processing 2.  Since I am a Java programmer, I wanted to make sure that I could implement what I learned in my own Java applications.
